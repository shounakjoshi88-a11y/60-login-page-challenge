Welcome to the **Cosmic Portal** gallery! 🌌 This is where I showcase  neon-glowing, astronaut-powered login experience.

Imagine this: You're floating through a wormhole. Stars are twinkling. A nebula is dancing in impossible colors. And there's an astronaut vibing with the cosmos, beckoning you through a dimensional gateway. That's not sci-fi—that's your login page now! 🧑‍🚀✨

## 🎨 What Makes It Special?

🌌 **Nebula Madness** - Swirling cyan, hot magenta, and deep purple cosmic clouds that feel alive  
🪐 **Planetary System** - Glowing celestial bodies with animated rings spinning in the void  
⭐ **Starfield Magic** - Thousands of twinkling stars suggesting infinite digital possibility  
💎 **Glassmorphic Vibes** - A frosted white glass card that floats effortlessly over chaos  
🔷 **Neon Everything** - Cyberpunk-inspired cyan glows and magenta highlights that pop
