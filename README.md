## 💡 What's This About?

Hey there! I'm a first-year CSE student challenging myself to create **60 unique login page designs** in about 60 days. No frameworks, no libraries—just pure HTML and CSS magic.

Why login pages? They're simple enough to complete daily but complex enough to explore different design philosophies, color theories, and CSS techniques. Plus, they're practical!

### 🎯 My Goals

- 🎨 Master modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid, animations, glassmorphism, neumorphism)
- ⚡ Build muscle memory through consistent daily coding
- 🌈 Explore different design aesthetics (cyberpunk, minimalist, retro, brutalist...)
- 📚 Create a resource others can learn from and use
- 🚀 Prove to myself that consistency beats perfection

---

## 📅 Timeline

**Start Date:** December 21, 2024 (right after my end-term exams!)  
**Target:** ~1 design per day  
**End Goal:** 60 unique, creative login pages

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** - Semantic structure
- **CSS3** - All the styling magic
  - Flexbox & Grid layouts
  - CSS animations & transitions
  - Custom properties (CSS variables)
  - Modern effects (blur, gradients, shadows)
- **No JavaScript** (keeping it pure CSS for now!)

## 💭 Why I'm Doing This

As a first-year student at Ramdeobaba University, I'm passionate about web development and design. I've been working on projects like:
- 🔥 c-practice repo (70+ C programs)
- 🎨 html-css-projects (web dev journey)
- 🤖 awesome-projects (AI/ML experiments)

This challenge is my way of:
1. Building a standout portfolio piece
2. Avoiding the "useless PR" trap (thanks Hitesh Choudhary for the wake-up call!)
3. Creating something genuinely useful for the community
4. Pushing my creative and technical boundaries
